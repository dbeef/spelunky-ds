<h2 align="center">To-do list as for now</h2>

- âœ” Implement shopkeeper logics and randomly spawned shops
- âœ” Implement damsel
- âœ” Implement caveman
- âœ” Implement skeleton
- âœ” Implement arrow trap
- âœ” Fix rope logics - if thrown, when it touches bottom of some tile above it or it reaches its maximum travel distance of 8 tiles up, then it should expand to the bottom. Now it's the opposite - it expands as it travels upwards.
- âœ” Implement cape and jetpack
- ðŸ—™ Putting project on Travis
- âœ” Implement 4 layers system - top one for the console and HUD, bottom one for tilemap and the rest for other creatures
- ðŸ—™ Tune-up the level generator; make it more random; add random events like snake well
- ðŸ—™ Implement music using streaming from filesystem - [I elaborated a bit on this on my blog](https://dbeef.wordpress.com/2018/05/24/some-words-on-developing-spelunkyds/)
- ðŸ—™ Pausing
- ðŸ—™ Jars dropping loot
- ðŸ—™ Ghost when spending too much time on level
- ðŸ—™ Shake screen when dropping a bomb
- ðŸ—™ Add github link to the main menu's copyrights sprite - so people would find the current version even if it was downloaded from some other source
- ðŸ—™ Attempt to make levels a bit bigger (current size is 512x512, what I can probably make is 1024x512 or 512x1024, though not sure of that)

Obviously I omit things like implement Olmec or implement lava city - let's finish cave level first.

<h2 align="center">Known bugs</h2>

- ðŸ—™ Though overall randomness of the generator is improved it sometimes makes some ugly structures, to be fixed later
- ðŸ—™ I messed up a bit with collision detection
- ðŸ—™ Arrow trap is triggered even if there's a tile (or tiles) between some moving object and the trap
- ðŸ—™ Once thrown chest can't be opened
- âœ” Sometimes there's a level where there are spikes just hanging in air
- ðŸ—™ Sometimes you can loose your items (shotgun, pistol) when changing levels
- ðŸ—™ UI bugs - you can throw rope / drop bomb in scores screen
- ðŸ—™ Damage system appears to be broken in terms of shopkeeper (you can't throw arrows, rocks, jars, etc on him)
- âœ” There's a bug when carrying damsel while sprinting through spikes
- ðŸ—™ There's a bug when jumping on more than one NPC (snake, bat, etc) at the same time
- ðŸ—™ Displaying loot in level-transition screen
- ðŸ—™ Shopkeeper is quite dumb, easy to steal
- ðŸ—™ Bullets can collide with jetpack, so it can work as a bulletproof vest
- ðŸ—™ Blood drops / bullets can trigger arrow trap
- ðŸ—™ Game tends to crash after some time of playing (at least on my vanilla DS) 

<h2 align="center">Building</h2>
In order to compile this application on your own, you will need [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) with the devkitARM toolchain, plus the necessary tools and libraries. devkitPro includes `dkp-pacman` for easy installation of all components:

```
 $ dkp-pacman -Syu devkitARM general-tools dstools ndstool libnds libfat-nds
```

Once everything is downloaded and installed, `git clone` this repository, navigate to the folder in which it was cloned, and run `make` to compile the application. If there is an error, let us know.

<h2 align="center">TroubleShooting</h2>

- If audio does not work, launch the application using TWiLightMenu++

<h2 align="center">Debugging</h2>
To compile SpelunkyDS with assertions fired up, type "make DEBUG=1" when compiling.
Debugging seemingly random crashes is possible only on an emulator, which will provide last executed line:

<p> What would be nice to add is printing to emulator's console for debugging purposes. 
 libnds ships such function calls (nds/arm9/console.h), but they work only on an emulator called nocash, which is Windows only. </p>
<p> Please contact me if you know any Linux NDS emulator that supports printing to terminal via nocash messages or you know how to log to desmume. </p>

<h2 align="center">Tools I use</h2>

- C++
- GNU Make </li>
- libnds - as included with devkitPro's toolchain https://devkitpro.org/
- mappy - https://tilemap.co.uk/mappy.php
- desmume emulator, for testing and debugging
- R4 card for testing on a real Nintendo DS Hardware
- gimp, for converting to 256 color (8bit) indexed bmp/png </li>
- [The Spelunky source code](http://www.derekyu.com/games/spelunky_1_1_src.zip) (distributed by Derek Yu) for inspiration
- [Spelunky assets](https://github.com/tyrovc/SpelunkyCommunityUpdateProject), which are taken from the Spelunky Community Update Project (because there's no need for installing Game Maker)
- CLion for editing
